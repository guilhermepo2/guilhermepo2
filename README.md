### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Guilherme and I'm currently working as a Software Engineer in the games industry!

I'm always learning and aiming to have public repositories, I've mostly been learning about SDL2 and the intricacies of making game engines and renderers, hopefully you can find some interesting things here, and also, feel free to fork, comment, make a pull request, you name it!
